# Ethereum Events & Transaction Real-time Analysis
This repository contains a system for monitoring Ethereum events and transactions to identify potential trading opportunities. It is designed to analyze on-chain data from the Ethereum blockchain, focusing on event logs and transaction patterns that are indicative of market movements or profitable trading signals.

## Project Overview
Ethereum's blockchain records a wealth of information in the form of smart contract events and transactions. By analyzing these logs in real-time or historical data, we can identify patterns that may provide insights into market sentiment and price movements.

This project is aimed at building an automated solution that can:

- **Monitor Ethereum events** like token transfers, contract interactions, and more.
- **Analyze transaction data** to identify trading signals such as large trades, arbitrage opportunities, or market manipulation.
- **Trigger notifications or alerts** for users when a potential trading opportunity is detected.
- **Generate reports** and insights about the market, based on recent transaction data.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Ethereum event monitoring**: Listen to contract events such as Transfer, Approval, Mint, etc., in real-time.
- **Transaction analysis**: Analyze Ethereum transactions for large transfers, gas usage, token swaps, and other trading signals.
- **Trading signal detection**: Identify potential trading opportunities like large whale movements, arbitrage opportunities, or price manipulation.
- **Customizable alerts**: Send notifications or alerts when certain patterns or conditions are met.
- **Data visualization and insights**: Optionally, visualize trading activity, token movements, and transaction volumes for market analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For event and transaction analysis, using libraries such as web3.py to interact with the Ethereum network.
- **Ethereum JSON-RPC**: To listen to events and fetch transaction data from Ethereum nodes.
- **Docker**: To containerize the application for easy deployment in various environments.
- **Kubernetes**: (Optional) For scaling and managing the service in cloud environments.

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yprakash/web3py.git
cd web3py
```
2. Install the required Python dependencies:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Set up your Ethereum node or connect via Infura by configuring the relevant API keys or endpoints in the .env file.
4. Start the event listener and analysis process:
```
python3 events/main.py
```

## Example Use Case

- **Spot Whale Movements**: The system can track large token transfers from one wallet to another and generate alerts when high-value transactions occur.
- **Arbitrage Opportunities**: By analyzing the transaction volume and timing across decentralized exchanges (DEXs), you can spot potential arbitrage opportunities.
- **Market Sentiment Analysis**: By examining the frequency and type of certain events (e.g., large trades, token swaps), you can gain insights into overall market sentiment or upcoming trends.
